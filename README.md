# Project 2 - Crowdfunding ETL  
## Task
For the ETL mini project, as a group we practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After the data  
has been transformed we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data was uploaded into a Postgres database.

## Jupyter Notebook files
